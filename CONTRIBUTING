# How to report a bug
    - if you want to report a bug
   or request a feature then use
   the codeberg issues tab

    - if you want to report
   a security vulnerability
   then message me via matrix:
   https://matrix.to/#/@rebok:matrix.org

# Setting up the environment
    You need to install
   gradle. Afterwards
   you can just run
   `gradle` or use features
   for managing gradle builds
   like in intelij idea
